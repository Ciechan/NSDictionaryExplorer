NSDictionaryExplorer
====================

This is a companion repo for my [blog post on internals of NSDictionary](http://ciechanowski.me/blog/2014/04/08/exposing-nsdictionary/). 

The Xcode project investigates the internal data structures of `NSDictionary` printing their contents to the console.

##Requirements

- iOS 7.1 device

##Important

This project might break in the future, it works as of iOS 7.1 SDK.

The sole purpose of this application is to `NSLog` stuff. It doesn't display anything on the screen.
